# Testing the Advanced Color Highlighting System

## ‚úÖ Unit Tests (Completed)

We've successfully created and run unit tests for the color highlighting system:

```bash
npx vitest run colorHighlight.simple.test.ts
```

**Test Results:**
- ‚úÖ 6 tests passed
- ‚úÖ ColorHighlightController initialization
- ‚úÖ Mesh creation and validation  
- ‚úÖ Untextured mesh handling
- ‚úÖ Resource cleanup
- ‚úÖ HSV color matching logic
- ‚úÖ Color tolerance calculations

## üåê Browser Testing

To test the interactive color highlighting in the browser:

### 1. Start Development Server
```bash
cd C:\GitHub\AkroSocketGen_V2\akro-socket-web\apps\web
npm run dev
```

### 2. Open Browser
Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173` (or whatever port Vite shows)

### 3. Test the Color Highlighting Feature

#### Step-by-Step Testing:

1. **Load a GLB File**
   - Click "Import File" or drag & drop a GLB file with textures
   - The 3D model should appear with original colors (no gray override)

2. **Open Color Analysis Panel**
   - Navigate to the "Analysis" tab
   - Wait for color analysis to complete
   - You should see the color palette extracted from the model

3. **Test Color Highlighting**
   - **Hover over any color** in the palette
   - The corresponding regions on the 3D model should highlight
   - You should see:
     - Purple "Highlighting..." indicator while processing
     - Green statistics showing matched pixels and coverage percentage
     - Real-time highlighting on the mesh

4. **Verify Features**
   - **Non-destructive**: Original materials are preserved
   - **HSV matching**: Similar colors are highlighted together
   - **Performance**: Smooth interaction with no lag
   - **Visual feedback**: Clear UI indicators for highlighting status

### 4. Expected Behavior

**‚úÖ Success Indicators:**
- GLB models display with original textures/colors
- Color palette shows extracted colors from the texture
- Hovering over colors highlights corresponding mesh regions
- Statistics show "X pixels (Y%)" coverage
- Smooth performance during interaction

**‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting:**
- If models appear gray: Check Canvas3D.tsx material override fix
- If highlighting doesn't work: Check browser console for worker errors
- If no colors appear: Ensure GLB has valid textures

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] GLB file imports successfully
- [ ] Model displays with original colors (not gray)
- [ ] Color analysis completes without errors
- [ ] Color palette displays extracted colors

### Interactive Highlighting  
- [ ] Hover over color triggers highlighting
- [ ] Corresponding mesh regions light up
- [ ] Statistics show accurate pixel counts
- [ ] Multiple colors can be tested
- [ ] Highlighting clears when mouse leaves color

### Performance & Stability
- [ ] No browser console errors
- [ ] Smooth highlighting performance
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable
- [ ] Multiple highlighting operations work
- [ ] Cleanup works when switching models

### Advanced Features
- [ ] HSV tolerance matching works for similar colors
- [ ] Different texture types are supported
- [ ] Large models perform acceptably
- [ ] Worker communication is reliable

## üéØ Demo Script

For a quick demo, try this sequence:

1. Load a colorful GLB model (prosthetic limb with skin tones works well)
2. Go to Analysis tab and wait for color extraction
3. Hover over different colors in the palette
4. Watch the corresponding regions highlight on the 3D model
5. Notice the real-time statistics showing coverage percentage

## üîç Debugging Tips

If issues occur, check:

1. **Browser DevTools Console** - Look for any JavaScript errors
2. **Network Tab** - Ensure worker files load correctly  
3. **Three.js Inspector** - Verify materials and textures are applied
4. **Performance Tab** - Check for memory leaks during highlighting

The system uses advanced techniques:
- Web Workers for texture analysis
- Custom Three.js shaders for highlighting
- HSV color space for intelligent matching
- Non-destructive material overlays

This represents a sophisticated solution to the challenging problem of interactive 3D color highlighting! üöÄ
