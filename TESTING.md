# Testing the Fixed Import Functionality

The `setFromBufferGeometry` error has been fixed! Here's how to test the application:

## Quick Test with Synthetic Files

1. Navigate to the fixtures directory:
   ```bash
   cd packages/fixtures/meshes
   ```

2. You should see these test files:
   - `synthetic-cylinder.obj` - A simple cylindrical mesh representing a prosthetic limb
   - `synthetic-cylinder.mtl` - Material file for the OBJ

3. In the browser at http://localhost:5173/:
   - Click "Or click to browse" or drag and drop the synthetic-cylinder.obj file
   - Also select the synthetic-cylinder.mtl file if prompted
   - The mesh should load and display in the 3D viewer

## What Was Fixed

The error `(intermediate value).setFromBufferGeometry is not a function` was caused by:

1. **Wrong Three.js API usage in BVH utilities** - `setFromBufferGeometry` doesn't exist, fixed by using `computeBoundingBox()` instead
2. **Incorrect three-mesh-bvh API usage** - Fixed the `closestPointOnSurface` function to use a simpler ray-casting approach
3. **Method chaining issues** - Fixed `setFromObject` calls to use proper instantiation

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ File drag-and-drop works without errors
- ✅ OBJ files load with proper geometry
- ✅ 3D viewer displays the mesh
- ✅ Bounding box calculations work correctly
- ✅ Units are detected/estimated properly
- ✅ BVH acceleration structure builds successfully

## Test Different File Types

Try loading:
- `.obj` files (with optional `.mtl`)
- `.glb` files (binary glTF)
- `.gltf` files (text glTF)

All should work without the previous error!

## Next Steps

With import working, you can now:
1. Load prosthetic limb meshes
2. Proceed to the "Auto-Detect Markings" tab (UI ready)
3. Use the "Edit Markings" tools (UI ready)
4. Generate sockets (algorithm needs implementation)
5. Export results (system ready)

The core infrastructure is now solid and ready for the advanced socket generation algorithms!
